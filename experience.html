    <h2 id="pagetitle">  Internship Experience </h2>
      <h3> Journey Websites, Social Media and Graphic Design Intern</h3>
      <h4> May 2020 - Present </h4>
    <p>Journey Websites is a small web-design firm that operates remotely out of South Bend, Indiana. I was hired originally
    as an unpaid intern doing mainly infographic work, but was promoted in August to a paid intern. As a paid intern,
    I have had the opportunity to manage the Journey Websites social media accounts on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn,
   and Pinterest. I produce ~90% of the content that is posted including captions, hashtags, designs, and comments. Through this
 position, I have been able to increase followers by over 100%, outreach by 344%, and interactions by 2,600%. Since the owner of Journey Websites
has trusted me with the social media accounts, I have been able to understand how the algorithms of different mainstream platforms
work, good practices of business to consumer marketing, and how to reach a client base better through an online presence. </p>
 <p>In addition to social media management experience, Journey Websites has given me ample experience working completely in a remote
 environment. I have been able to complete all of the typical business functions and participate fully as a productive member
of the Journey team. I am currently learning Adobe Creative Cloud software and experimenting with logo design, which I hope to
get better at as my career progresses, since I enjoy graphic design. Ultimately, Journey Websites is a great company to work with, and I
very lucky to be a part of the team. </p>
      <h3> Flixi, Social Media Intern</h3>
      <h4> September 2020 - Present </h4>
    <p>Flixi is a very small start-up, launched during the pandemic, that sells adult products. At Flixi, I am an unpaid intern
    and I focus my efforts on producing social media content. I work directly alongside the CEO to produce content for Instagram, Twitter,
  and Facebook. In addition, I am working to enhance the search engine optimization (SEO) of the website so that it is more
easily accessible to potential customers. Currently, my boss and I are working to establish an online presence that accurately
represents our values and mission statement; moreover, we are planning a new medium for sales which will require dedicated commitment
to our customer's desires and efficient two-way communication. Though Flixi is small, I enjoy seeing it grow and getting to be
a part of its process. </p>
    <h2> Work Experience </h2>
      <h3> Target </h3>
      <h4> August 2019 - September 2020 </h4>
    <p> I was employed by Target as a style consultant for just over a year. Target, though I do not currently work there, was
    a worthwhile job. I received great pay and fair treatment. In addition, I gained retail experience in a fast-paced environment and
  had to learn to adapt and be flexible in unprecedented circumstances during the Covid pandemic. While at Target, I developed better conflict-resolution
skills and practiced communicating with company superiors. Though retail has its fair share of ups and downs, Target was a great place to work
and I recommend it to anyone that needs a stable job. </p>
