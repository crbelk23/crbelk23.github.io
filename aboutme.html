    <h2 id="pagetitle"> About Me </h2>
  <div style="display:flex;margin:40px 15% 40px 15%;align-items:center;"> <img src="SLG Letters photo.jpg" alt="" width="400"> <p class="aboutme" style="margin-left:40px;"> Hello! My name is Cassidy Belk, and I am a junior marketing major at Valparaiso
      University in Valparaiso, Indiana. I grew up in Northwest Indiana as the oldest of five children. When I was a kid,
      I passed the time by playing softball, painting, and learning to play various musical instruments, a few of which I still do as an
      adult. I have a passion for music, and my favorite instruments to play are guitar, bass, piano, ukulele, and drums.
      Because of my love for music, I listen to it constantly. My favorite music genres are rock, metal, alternative, and R&B.
      At Valparaiso University, I have put my musical interests to work for Hooked On Tonics A capella, which I am the president of.
    </p></div>
    <div style="display:flex;margin:40px 15% 40px 15%;align-items:center;">  <p class="aboutme" style="margin-right:40px;"> In addition to my noteable love for music, I have many other demonstrated interests and hobbies.
      I have a soft spot for animals,
      especially my recently rescued puppy named Chuck Norris: a border collie yorkie mix. Some of my other interests include
      art, graphic design, motorcycles, and baking. I have varied interests that stretch across a wide range of industries.</p><img src="Norris standing photo.jpg" alt="" width="400"></div>
  <div style="display:flex;margin:40px 15% 40px 15%;align-items:center;"><img src="Norris laying photo.jpg" alt="" width="400">  <p class="aboutme" style="margin-left:40px";> When I am more developed in my career, I hope to travel the world and see as much of it as I can. I enjoy meeting new
      people and hearing their unique stories. In the summer of 2019, I discovered my love for traveling when I spent three
      months on the west coast near San Fransisco, California. </p></div>
  <div style="display:flex;margin:40px 15% 40px 15%;align-items:center;">  <p class="aboutme" style="margin-right:40px;"> I consider myself a very strong-willed person. Despite my dedicated passion for certain matters, I try to be mindful
      of opinions different from my own. Some of my personal values include honesty, integrity, empathy, and responsibility.
      In my everyday life, I like to research and actively engage in political activism for the movements I am passionate about
      such as Black Lives Matter, LGBTQ+ rights, women's rights, etc. My interest in activism and learning about others
      led me to Sigma Lambda Gamma National Sorority. Becoming a Gamma and being surrounded by so many inspirational women has helped me
      find the balance between being strong and outspoken but also understanding and kind. Regardless of my own opinions, I try my best to make every decision, no matter how big or small,
      with the feelings and wellbeing of others in mind.</p><img src="Golden Gate Bridge 2019 photo.jpg"" alt="" width="400"></div>

      one of my social media channels linked at the top of the page. Thanks! </p>
